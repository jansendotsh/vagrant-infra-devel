# vagrant-infra-devel

## Goal

This is a repository built to store my Vagrant environments for work across several machines. Currently, this only contains a single web development host and a basic creation using an Ansible provisioner. This will grow and be modularized as we proceed. 

## Requirements

- Vagrant
- Ansible (running with Python 3)

## toDo

- Break out `basic_setup` role to separate repo referenced by module.
- Add Docker role via module.
